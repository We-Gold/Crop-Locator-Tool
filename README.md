# Crop Locator Tool

A tool that locates crops taken from medical images (tiffs), including rotated and resliced crops.

This tool is useful in a lab setting, for example, a crop is taken from a 3D tiff in Fiji, but the location is not recorded. Upload the original image and the crop to our tool, and it will locate the crop.
